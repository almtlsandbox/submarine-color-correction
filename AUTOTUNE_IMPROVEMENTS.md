# Auto-Tune Lake Mode Improvements

## Problem Analysis

The auto-tune functionality in lake mode was generating overly aggressive parameters that resulted in:
- Over-saturated, unnatural-looking images
- Excessive brightness and contrast
- Loss of natural color balance
- Harsh transitions and artifacts

## Specific Issues Fixed

### 1. White Balance Strength
**Before:** 1.2 base + up to 0.8 boost = max 1.8
**After:** 1.0 base + up to 0.4 boost = max 1.3
- Reduced base strength from 1.2 to 1.0
- Reduced green dominance multiplier from 0.8 to 0.4
- Reduced maximum from 1.8 to 1.3

### 2. Red Channel Enhancement
**Before:** 1.4 base + up to aggressive compensation = max 2.2
**After:** 1.2 base + moderate compensation = max 1.6
- Reduced base scale from 1.4 to 1.2
- Reduced green compensation multiplier from 0.5 to 0.3
- Reduced maximum from 2.2 to 1.6

### 3. Magenta Compensation
**Before:** Fixed levels (1.1, 1.3, 1.6)
**After:** Adaptive levels with aggressiveness factor
- Strong: 1.6 → 1.4 (reduced)
- Medium: 1.3 → 1.2 (reduced)
- Light: 1.1 → 1.0 (minimal correction)
- Added green dominance consideration alongside green ratio

### 4. Turbidity/Dehazing
**Before:** Base 0.6 + turbidity * 0.5, max 1.8, compensation up to 2.0
**After:** Base 0.5 + turbidity * 0.3, max 1.0, compensation up to 1.5
- Reduced base strength from 0.6 to 0.5
- Reduced haze level multiplier from 1.8 to 1.2
- Reduced turbidity boost from 0.5 to 0.3
- Reduced maximum dehaze strength from 1.8 to 1.0
- Reduced turbidity compensation from 2.0 to 1.5

### 5. Saturation Enhancement
**Before:** Very aggressive (1.2, 1.4, 1.6)
**After:** More balanced (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)
- Added more gradual levels
- Reduced maximum from 1.6 to 1.4
- Added intermediate level at 1.3

### 6. CLAHE (Contrast)
**Before:** Base 3.0 + boosts, max 4.5
**After:** Base 2.5 + reduced boosts, max 3.5
- Reduced base clip from 3.0 to 2.5
- Reduced turbidity boost from 0.8 to 0.5
- Adjusted contrast calculation divisor from 200 to 300
- Reduced maximum from 4.5 to 3.5

### 7. Adaptive Aggressiveness
**New Feature:** Added intelligence to reduce parameter aggressiveness based on:
- **Confidence Level:** If water detection confidence < 0.8, apply 0.8× modifier
- **Green Dominance:** If green dominance < 0.3, apply 0.7× modifier
- Combined modifiers can reduce aggressiveness significantly for uncertain cases

### 8. Green Water Processor Depth Factor
**Before:** depth_proxy * 3.0, max 2.0
**After:** depth_proxy * 2.0, max 1.5
- Reduced depth influence multiplier from 3.0 to 2.0
- Reduced maximum depth factor from 2.0 to 1.5
- This prevents over-correction in lake attenuation compensation

## Expected Results

The improved auto-tuner should now:
1. **Produce more natural-looking results** with balanced color correction
2. **Avoid over-saturation** while still enhancing lake photos effectively
3. **Adapt better to different scenarios** with the aggressiveness factor
4. **Maintain effective green cast removal** without being too harsh
5. **Preserve detail and avoid artifacts** through moderate parameter ranges

## Technical Implementation

All improvements maintain backward compatibility and the same API. The changes are internal to the auto-tuner logic and don't affect:
- Manual parameter adjustment
- UI controls
- Saved settings
- Processing pipeline structure

## Testing Guidelines

To verify improvements:
1. Load lake/freshwater images with green cast
2. Use Auto-Tune button
3. Check that results are:
   - More natural and less over-processed
   - Still effective at removing green cast
   - Better balanced in brightness and contrast
   - More suitable as starting points for manual fine-tuning

The auto-tuner should now provide better starting parameters that require less manual adjustment while still being effective at correcting green water issues.
