# Image Loading Enhancement Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented the requested enhancement for image loading behavior to improve user experience when navigating between images.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Method in ImageViewer (`src/ui/widgets/image_viewer.py`)
Added `clear_processed_image_and_adjust_view()` method that:
- Clears any existing processed image when loading a new image
- Automatically switches from "Corrected" view to "Original" view when loading new images
- Preserves "Split" view selection if that mode was active
- Preserves "Original" view if already selected

### 2. Enhanced Image Loading (`src/ui/main_window_clean.py`)
Modified both `_load_current_image()` and `_load_current_frame()` methods to:
- Call the new view adjustment method after loading each new image/frame
- Ensure consistent behavior across both image files and video frames

## Behavior Details

### When Loading a New Image:
1. **If "Original" view is selected**: Keeps "Original" view (no change needed)
2. **If "Corrected" view is selected**: Automatically switches to "Original" view
3. **If "Split" view is selected**: Keeps "Split" view (but processed side will be empty until new processing is applied)

### Benefits:
- **User Experience**: No more confusing blank screens when switching between images while in "Corrected" view
- **Logical Flow**: When you load a new image, you see the original first, which makes sense
- **Split View Preservation**: Users who prefer split view can keep that mode active
- **Consistent Behavior**: Works the same for both image files and video frames

## Technical Implementation

The solution involves:
1. **State Management**: Properly clearing processed image data when loading new content
2. **UI Synchronization**: Using Tkinter's StringVar to update radio button selection
3. **View Mode Logic**: Intelligent handling of different view modes based on user preference
4. **Display Updates**: Ensuring the UI refreshes to show the changes immediately

## Testing
The application starts successfully and the implementation is ready for testing:
1. Load multiple images
2. Switch to "Corrected" view and apply some processing
3. Navigate to next image - should automatically switch to "Original" view
4. Try with "Split" view - should preserve split view mode
5. Test with both image files and video frames

## Files Modified
- `src/ui/widgets/image_viewer.py`: Added new method for view management
- `src/ui/main_window_clean.py`: Enhanced image and frame loading methods

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
