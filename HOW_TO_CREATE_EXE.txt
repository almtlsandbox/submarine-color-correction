INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE EXE FILE
================================

Due to path length limitations, follow these steps to create the executable:

OPTION A: Short Path Method
===========================
1. Copy your entire project folder to a short path like:
   C:\submarine-color-correction

2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and navigate to the folder:
   cd C:\submarine-color-correction

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install PyInstaller if not installed:
   pip install pyinstaller

5. Create the executable:
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "SubmarineColorCorrection" src/main.py

6. Find your executable in the 'dist' folder

OPTION B: Using Auto-Py-To-Exe (Recommended)
============================================
1. Install auto-py-to-exe:
   pip install auto-py-to-exe

2. Run the GUI:
   auto-py-to-exe

3. Configure in the GUI:
   - Script Location: [browse to your src/main.py]
   - Onefile: One File
   - Console Window: Window Based (hide the console)
   - Name: SubmarineColorCorrection
   - Click "CONVERT .PY TO .EXE"

OPTION C: Alternative Tools
===========================
You can also use:
- cx_Freeze: pip install cx_Freeze
- Nuitka: pip install nuitka
- py2exe (Windows only): pip install py2exe

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
- If antivirus blocks the executable, add an exception
- If the .exe is large (~100-200MB), this is normal for GUI apps with OpenCV
- The executable will contain all dependencies and can run on machines without Python

YOUR PROJECT IS READY FOR EXE CONVERSION!
All necessary files are prepared and dependencies are properly configured.
